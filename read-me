Created a replica of the iconic Flappy Bird game using Pygame, a python based graphic library. 
I integrated basic game development concepts as well as OOP concepts like use of sprites, classes, functions, event handling, collision detection, game loop etc

To run the program, downlaod repo and run "python flappyBird.py" on the terminal while accessing that folder, and enjoy the game :)
